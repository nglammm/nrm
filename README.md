[![N|Solid](https://i.ibb.co/sHF7y3D/Powered-by-the-NRM-GROUP.png)](http://nrm.us.to)

**Below is a poorly made documentation, please stay tuned because NRM project is still in very early development.**

## Features (at this moment):

Features that NRM has.

### NRM Language

- Variables declarations
- Equations solved
- Show (print) function

### NRM Syntax

**Data types**

Currently, we only support number, string, null, array and boolean
For example: true represents the normal true value for almost every programming language. Same for false
null represents null in almost every programming language
Strings can be used between `'` and `"` just like any other languages.
Array starts with a `[` and ends with `]`. To seperate elements, we use `;`.

**ARRAY TIPS**

You can spam as much `;` as you can when seperating elements in an array. The demo image of it is shown in many channels like ⁠memes and ⁠development

**Variables**

To declare a variable, we introduce 7 different ways of doing it:

```
variable <var_name> is <value>
let <var_name> be <value> (the most used one)
constant <var_name> is <value>
create: variable <var_name> is <value>
create: constant <var_name> is <value>
create: changeable <var_name> is <value>
create: unchangeable <var_name> is <value>
```
To update a variable, we use: `<var_name> is now <value>`

Way number 1, 2, 4, 6 creates a mutable variable while way number 3, 5, 7 creates a constant.

### NRM Console

- Run: Run nrm files (using current NRM Language available features)
- Packages: Will install addons for your NRM (still, WIP)
  + Download (will have install when the NRM Language has that function)
  + Reinstall (just remove that package and install it again)
  + Uninstall (remove that package)
  + Upload (Upload your packages: now just upload a dir, will be specified when NRM Language is finished; verify needs email)
  + Manage (Manages your uploaded packages; verify needs email)
- Alias: run long commands shorter
