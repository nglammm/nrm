You can freely edit this file as a readme for your package.
This is the bare minimum for uploading a package to library NRM.
Inside the file 'details.nrm-package' you can edit the details of your project that satisfies your need. The 'package_name' must not exceed 30 characters, 'package_version' maximum structure is x.x.x.x where 'x' stands for a number and 'package_description' should not exceed 300 characters. If your file 'details.nrm-package' don't qualify those requirements your upload request will be rejected.
If you finished the project, there is one more step to go:
run command: 

"""nrm
upload {dir}"""

That's it!
